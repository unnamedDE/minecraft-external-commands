# Actions outside of minecraft triggered by commands inside minecraft

Electron project with the following commands:

* /node log \<log> : Logs text to console
* /node exit : quits program
* /node google \<search> : searches sth. on google
* /node open-link \<link> : opens link in default browser
* /node run \<path> : runs program (WIP)

### Players have to run these commands (no commandblocks/functions)

Inspired by AgentM and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxDhuZ57_0) who did this in python

##### After cloning the repo, make sure you have [nodeJS](nodejs.org/en/download/) installed and run *npm install*.
To start the program run *npm start* or *electron .*
